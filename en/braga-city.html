            <p>Braga is a city of enormous beauty and wealth of heritage, which combines tradition with innovation,
                memory with youth, creativity with conservatism.<br>
                <br>
                With more than 2000 years of a rich history, it has one of the oldest Sacro-Montes of all Europe and
                standard bearer of the region Minhota, Bom Jesus. It is in Braga that there is the oldest Cathedral of
                Portugal and the Mother House of the Benedictines, the Monastery of Tibães.<br>
                <br>
                Braga presents places that, due to their intrinsic devotion and beauty, impose themselves as landmarks
                of obligatory reference and visit. The Sanctuary of Sameiro, Bom Jesus and Falperra, based on an
                appealing religious base, are surrounded by charming green spaces and paradisiacal landscapes.<br>
                <br>
                The Roman legacy is another of the attractive factors of Braga, often dubbed 'Portuguese Rome', fruit
                of its origin in the roman city of Bracara Augusta. Known for its distinctive churches, splendid 18th
                century houses, gardens, parks and leisure spaces. The long history of Braga is visible in all the
                splendour of its monuments, museums and churches.<br>
                <br>
                To visit Braga is to make a trip in time within the modernity. Old town and traditional religiosity -
                always imposing on its richness and majesty - lives hand in hand with entrepreneurship and young spirit
                in such vital areas as culture, commerce, gastronomy, industry and services.<br>
                <br>
                Enjoy Braga! From here, start the discovery of Gerês, Northern Portugal and Galicia, but come back ...
                Come back because here it is close to everything.<br>
                <br>
                In Braga, feel good, in this land so welcoming, close, distinct and complete! We hope to see you here
                and talk about us!<br>
